> without __init__.py file we can not create a package. To convert any python folder into package we need to add __init__.py file in that folder.
> package is a collection of libraries.




           <----------------------   SENSOR folder is root dicectiory   -------------------->   


**pipeline**: [pipeline is a sequence if steps that execute in orders]. In machine learning we have training and prediction pipeline. 

** components** : Every pipeline has some components arrange in specific order. [like: data_validation, model, training, model_validation etc.]
                  - we have to arrange components in a specific order to run a pipeline.

**data_access**: we have to bring our data from some kind of data base like momgoDB, Mysql etc. 
                 - So, here we wirte a code to bring data in current dicectiory and use like a csv file for model developement.
 
**cloud_storage**: How we can manage file accross cloud. 
                   We are unsing S3 bucket. here we will write code for how to download file from S3 bucket, 
                   how to upload file in S3 bucket, how to download model from S3 bucket, how to create bucket Etc.


**configuration**:  Here we will manage the connections related configuration for example MongoDB connection. 
                    we need to centralaized the connection amoung the components.

**constant**:      Every project has some folder name, database name, file name, model name Eg. [model.plk file]. 
                   These are hard coded values to maintain their names. It contain variable declariation 

**entity**:       We have to manage the input and output of the every component and pipeline also. 
                  It define the structure like data type of input and output values

**ml**:           You need to customize some of the algorithm. 
                  [like creating your own loss function, some custom feature engineering, some custom model, custom accuracy Etc.]



SENSOR FOLDER FILES: 

__init__.py
**exception.py**     We have to capture the abnormality in your code.
**logger.py**        What is happening into your code. 



**ML Artifact**-When ever you running a pipeline. if something is genarating through your pipeline then the output is we called as Artifact.
